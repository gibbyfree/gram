# Gram

Gram is a Rust-based implementation of [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo), a simple text editor. I loosely followed [this guide](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) during development.

Usage: `./gram <filename>` 
Example: `./gram sample.c`

Keyboard shortcuts:
```
CTRL-S: Save
CTRL-Q: Quit
CTRL-F: Find string in file (ESC to exit search, arrows to navigate)
```
